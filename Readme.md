# qtcreator-template-sfml

With [qtcreator-template-sfml](https://github.com/maidis/qtcreator-template-sfml), a simple SFML example can be created that uses one of the CMake, QMake, Qbs build systems.

Just tested on Fedora. For now, it's likely that it'll not work on other Linux distributions, other operating systems, or other processor architectures without some changes being made.

So any contribution to the project is welcomed :smiley:


## Installation

To use the template in Qt Creator, copy the whole directory here:

```bash
$HOME/.config/QtProject/qtcreator/templates/wizards/
```
